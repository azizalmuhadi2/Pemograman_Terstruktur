cstring - This is a header file in C++ that provides functions to manipulate strings and arrays of characters.

cin.get() - This function is used to get a single character from the input stream. It reads the next character 
from the stream and returns it as an integer.

cin.ignore() - This function is used to ignore a specific number of characters from the input stream. It is 
commonly used to ignore newline characters that are left in the input stream after reading input.

cin.putback() - This function is used to put a single character back into the input stream. It is commonly used 
to put back a character that was read from the stream but was not used.

strlen() - This function is used to find the length of a null-terminated string (a string that ends with a null character).

strcat() - This function is used to concatenate two null-terminated strings. It takes two arguments, the first 
argument is the destination string where the concatenated string will be stored and the second argument is the source string.

strtol() - This function is used to convert a string to a long integer. It takes two arguments, the first argument is 
the string to be converted and the second argument is a pointer to a character that points to the first character that is not part of the number.

strtoul() - This function is similar to strtol(), but it is used to convert a string to an unsigned long integer.

strtod() - This function is used to convert a string to a double-precision floating-point number. It takes two arguments, 
the first argument is the string to be converted and the second argument is a pointer to a character that points 
to the first character that is not part of the number.
